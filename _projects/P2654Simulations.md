title: "P2654Simulations"
excerpt: "This repository is my playground where I am developing myHDL simulation logic modules to simulate different use cases for the IEEE P2654 and P1687.1 working groups so we can see how our ideas fit with real examples."

This project is set up to be the repository for experimenting with myHDL models that provide an implementation of use cases the IEEE P2654 and P1687.1 working groups desire to test solutions on.  See the README.md page on the GitHub site for the details of this project.
