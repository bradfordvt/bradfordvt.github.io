Since retiring from Nokia, I have been keeping active developing my skills and passion for Python programming.  I have also been interested in learning new skills, like web development, to get a better understanding how other industries outside of embedded programming use software tools and languages.  I have also been able to spend time on some of my personal projects I have always been wanting to get to, but have been too busy with work and other industry activities.

Although dabbling in new technology is fun and challenging, I desire to find a place in industry where I can apply my skills to real world problems and continue to challenge myself to find commonsense solutions to unresolved issues.  I also find I miss being able to mentor colleagues and watch them grow as they learn.  I am able to continue some of my mentoring friendships, but it is not the same as working with colleagues tackling real world problems.

In the meantime, I am consulting with friends and industry contacts regarding Small Office Home Office (SOHO) Layouts, Boundary-Scan Test, System Test, Board Test, and embedded instrumentation.

I would love to talk to you about work I can do for you.<br>

## Home Projects
I have found I was pretty successful at tackling many of my personal projects over the years, but only by prioritizing what I needed at the time and focusing on those.  **Network Attached Storage (NAS) for my home office** was the most important and required a lot of product evaluations and experimentation.  I tried a few commercial products hoping for an "Off-the-Shelf" solution to my NAS needs.  Check out my [Network Attached Storage (NAS) home project page](/home_projects/NASExperiment/index.html).

## Industry Standards Contributions
I am actively involved in various IEEE Standards Working Groups helping to define new standards for testing systems.  Check out all of my standards pages for more information:
[IEEE Std 1581](/standards/IEEE_1581/index.html)<br>
[IEEE Std 1687](/standards/IEEE_1687_IJTAG/index.html)<br>
[IEEE P1687.1](/standards/IEEE_P1687_1/index.html)<br>
[IEEE P2654](/standards/IEEE_P2654_STAM/index.html)<br>
[SJTAG](/standards/SJTAG/index.html)

## Open Source Contributions
I am beginning to publish various blocks of code that I have found useful when developing new embedded instruments to aid in the analysis and simulation of the hardware designs.  These are based on the myHDL package in Python.  I am also posting forks of current open source projects that I needed to alter or update to find useful for my work.
