At the IEEE European Board Test Workshop held in Tallinn, Estonia, May 2005, a group of 14 board test professionals met to discuss a common set of problems associated with the extended test and configuration use of 1149.1 boundary-scan infrastructure within complex multi-board systems. As a result of this discussion, it was decided to create a system-level JTAG initiative, called System JTAG (SJTAG). It also was decided to create a [white paper](http://sjtag.org/index.php/documents/sjtag-white-paper) to more clearly define the nature of these problems and hence their possible solutions.
