SELECTED ACCOMPLISHMENTS

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
- Analyzed legacy radio test software, Design & Verification Test (DVT) process, and Integration & Verification (I&V) process, identifying process improvements resulting in design and development of Python-based TesterFramework package. Reduced test development from 6 months to 2 weeks. Allowed the use of Test Driven Development (TDD) for both hardware and software, easy evolution of 3GPP test cases as prototype radio hardware and software changed, enabled test portability between test stations, automated test equipment control, and automated documentation in MS Excel worksheets with embedded images of instrument screen captures.
- Identified missing tooling for testing new FPGA and SoC (System-on-Chip) IP (Intellectual Property) logic, leading to development of special software tools to generate and analyze patterns required to test these interfaces. Integrated bit-accurate C MATLAB models into tooling to compute equivalent FFT / iFFT used by IP logic.
- Created the embedded boundary-scan (EBS) architecture being used in over 20 products (over 60 board integrations) providing a common interface for structural test, programming, fault injection, and various other features all ported to Windows, Solaris, Linux, VxWorks, and several stand-alone platforms. 1 case of remote update using this method saved more than $1M in Supply Chain costs alone.
- Invented the Test Flow Control Language(TM) (TFCL(TM)), instrumental in decoupling dependencies between EBS applications and the embedded system software.

ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
- In 4 days, salvaged first samples of SoC devices by automating SoC team workaround, supporting automatic boot of instances on various new board designs. Built Raspberry Pi3-based solution and designed equivalent solution using the radio's FPGA for auto-boot of the multiple instances of SoC on each radio. This kept plan on target.
- Co-developed high-speed embedded Test Access Port (TAP) Controller IP (40MHz TCK) to facilitate embedded testing.
- Co-developed various FPGA-based, instrument IP as embedded test enhancements providing an increase in test coverage, faster tests, and enabling at-speed testing of interfaces.

TECHNICAL LEADER
- Guided small development team creating test software and platforms for testing prototype mobile 4G LTE / 5G radio designs. Improved efficiency of test development by a factor of 12.
- Led and mentored group of 7 developers constructing advanced board and system test CAE tools supporting test of backplanes, device clusters, boards and systems as well as support remote programming, fault injection and embedded tooling.
- Mentored Bell Labs-Ireland team developing novel JTAG management designs in SoCs.

INDUSTRY LEADER
- Chaired IEEE System Joint Test Action Group (SJTAG) Investigation Group defining new system test standards for industry (2006 - 2008).
- Authored boundary-scan sections for both the Advanced Mezzanine Card (PICMG(R) AMC.0 R1.0) base specification and MicroTCA (PICMG(R) MicroTCA.0.9) base specification of the Advanced Telecom Compute Architecture (PICMG 3.x / ATCA) standard.
- Core member of the IEEE Std 1581 Static Component Interconnection Test Protocol and Architecture committee (2005-2008) and the IEEE Std 1687 Standard for Access and Control of Instrumentation Embedded within a Semiconductor Device committee (2005-2014).
- Currently core member of the IEEE P2654 System Test and Access Management (STAM) and IEEE P1687.1 Standard for the Application of Interfaces and Controllers to Access 1687 IJTAG Networks Embedded Within Semiconductor Devices.
